Gabriel works at the intersection of institutions and political behavior, seeking to better understand the ways in which citizens with less education are mobilized into politics and how this process is shaped by, and reshapes, the distribution of economic resources in society. He has [field experience](experience/#field_experience) conducting surveys, interviews, and experiments in southern and east Africa, as well as advanced [methodological training](training).

His [current projects](#current-projects) include studies of the effects of campaign mobilization on political interest in the United States, the strategic responses of trade unions to globalization in rich countries, and what determines local government responsiveness to citizen pressure in South Africa. Before coming to MIT, Gabriel spent two years as a Research and Training Officer for [Equal Education](experience/#professional_experience), a social movement organization in South Africa.

At MIT, Gabriel is a member of the [MIT Gov/Lab](http://www.mitgovlab.org/), a research team dedicated to practice-oriented research on political accountability, and is also a founding member of MIT’s Reading Group on African Politics. Gabriel currently serves on [MIT’s Corporation Joint Advisory Committee] (https://corporation.mit.edu/committees/additional-committees/corporation-joint-advisory-committee-institute-wide-affairs-cjac), is a longstanding member of the Political Science Graduate Student Council, and administers the department’s graduate student working group.

Most recently, Gabriel is a winner of the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship] (https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the [Kenan Sahin Presidential Fellowship] (https://oge.mit.edu/finances/fellowships/presidential/).
