Gabriel works at the intersection of institutions and political behavior, seeking to better understand the ways in which low-resource actors are mobilized into politics and how this process is shaped by, and reshapes, the distribution of economic resources in society. He has experience managing surveys, interviews, and experiments in southern and east Africa. His current projects include studies of the effects of campaign mobilization on political interest in the United States, the strategic responses of trade unions to globalization in rich countries, and what determines local government responsiveness to citizen pressure in South Africa.

At MIT he is a member of the Gov/Lab, a research team dedicated to building our understanding of how to increase political accountability. He is a founding member of MIT’s Reading Group on African Politics. Gabriel also, he serves on MIT’s Corporation Joint Advisory Committee, is a longstanding member of the political science graduate student council, and administers the department’s graduate student working group.

Before coming to MIT, Gabriel spent two years working for a social movement organization in South Africa targeting issues of education inequality. He holds a BA/MA in political science, as well as a BA in African studies, from Emory University in Atlanta, GA.

Gabriel is a winner of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research and Kenan Sahin Presidential Fellowships.
