Gabriel's research seeks to understand the ways in which citizens with fewer resources become motivated to participate in politics and how this process is shaped by, and reshapes, the distribution of economic resources in society. He has [field experience](experience/#field_experience) conducting surveys, interviews, and experiments in southern and east Africa as well as the United States. Gabriel also has advanced [methodological training](training) in both quantitative and qualitative techniques.

Gabriel's [dissertation work](https://gabrielnahmias.com/files/nahmias_firstcolloquium.pdf) addresses our understanding of when individuals will choose to "organize," to center recruiting the disengaged into politics, as their method of creating social change. His ongoing [projects](#current-projects) include a study of how campaign mobilization shapes political interest in the United States, a review of how activists can overcome the collective action problem, and a white paper for the MIT Work of the Future Taskforce on strategic innovations in the American labor movement.

At MIT, Gabriel is a member of the [MIT Gov/Lab](http://www.mitgovlab.org/), a research team dedicated to practice-oriented research on political accountability. Most recently, Gabriel is a winner of the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship] (https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the [Kenan Sahin Presidential Fellowship] (https://oge.mit.edu/finances/fellowships/presidential/).

Before coming to MIT, Gabriel spent two years as a Research and Training Officer for [Equal Education](experience/#professional_experience), a social movement organization in South Africa.
